## Question 1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
read_csv(here::here("data/college-majors.csv"),col_types = cols(
  Major_category = col_factor()), na = c("", "NA", "679"))
```


## Question 2
```{r}
library(babynames)
baby_top10 <- babynames |> filter(sex == "M" & year < 2000 & year >= 1990) |>
  group_by(name) |>
  summarise(n_births = sum(n)) |>
  arrange(desc(n_births)) |>
  slice(1:10) |>
  mutate(factored_name = fct_reorder(.f = name, .x = n_births))

ggplot(data = baby_top10, aes(x = factored_name, y = n_births)) + 
  geom_col(colour = "black", fill = "white") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Question 3
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
statement_df <- tibble::tibble(statement = c("Climate change is a global issue", "Poverty", "Civil Rights"),
                               agree = c(50, 60, 60),
                               neutral = c(10, 5, 10),
                               disagree = c(5, 4, 7),
                               total = c(65, 69, 77),
                               statement_long = c("Climate change is a global issue",
                                                  "Poverty is a global issue",
